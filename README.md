## Introduction

My task is to utilize given code to create an application that an employee can use to generate a secure password based on selectors they choose. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write.

The password can include special characters following guidelines from [OWASP Fondation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

The Acceptance Criteria is as follows.

- [x] Generates a new secure password.
- [x] Prompts the user for password criteria.
- [x] Choose length between 8 and 128.
- [x] Choose types from Lower Case, Upper Case, Numeric, and Special Characters.
- [ ] Validates the users choices.
- [x] It shows the generated password in the center box.
